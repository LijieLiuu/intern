how to solve conflict in this project
===

One of the main conflicts during this project was navigating a disagreement within the intern group about which front-end framework to use. Most interns leaned toward JSP, mainly because it was what we had learned in class and felt safer. However, I believed React was a better fit for the project’s long-term scalability and user experience. The platform we were building involved dynamic filtering, responsive UI, and frequent updates from the backend — and I knew from experience that React handled state management and component reusability much more cleanly than JSP.

The conflict wasn’t just about preference — it came from uncertainty about taking on something new mid-project, concerns about learning curve, and fear of slowing things down. But at that point, it wasn’t about who was right or wrong—it was about keeping the team moving forward without letting the disagreement stall our progress.

So instead of debating, I focused on building a small working prototype in React that replicated a key part of our app — the course filtering interface. I added responsive layout, real-time search updates, and cleaner code organization. Once people saw how much smoother the user interaction was and how easy it was to maintain and expand the code, the conversation quickly shifted from opinions to concrete results.

After that, we were able to align and move forward as a team using React. The key takeaway for me was that when conflicts happen, especially in team settings, the priority should always be solving the problem—not proving a point. Clear communication and constructive action often speak louder than arguments.
