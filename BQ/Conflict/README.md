One of the main challenges during this project was navigating a disagreement within the intern group about which front-end framework to use. Most interns leaned toward JSP, mainly because it was what we had learned in class and felt safer. I believed React was a better fit for the project’s long-term scalability and user experience.

At that point, it wasn’t about who was right or wrong—it was about keeping the team moving forward without letting the disagreement slow us down. So instead of debating, I focused on building a small working prototype in React to show the actual difference. This helped shift the conversation from opinions to results.

Once people saw the benefits firsthand, we quickly aligned and moved forward as a team. The key takeaway for me was that when conflicts happen, especially in team settings, the priority should always be solving the problem—not proving a point. Clear communication and constructive action often speak louder than arguments.
