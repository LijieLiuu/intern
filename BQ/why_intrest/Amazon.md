I’m interested in Amazon because I’ve seen how seriously it takes customer experience. I’ve been using Amazon Prime for years — whether it’s getting a laptop charger the next day, tracking a delayed shipment, or streaming shows without buffering, it just works. Even when things go wrong, like a package being late, Amazon fixes it quickly. That level of consistency really stands out.

From the outside, it’s clear that Amazon doesn’t just say “customer first” — it actually builds everything around it. Whether it’s how the site recommends products or how support handles problems, you can tell there are systems and people behind it who really care. What I’ve seen from using Amazon — and from how the products consistently deliver — is that there’s a deep focus on customers and high standards. That really lines up with how I like to work: focusing on the user, paying attention to details, and doing things the right way instead of the easy way.

I’ve had a taste of that myself — at school, I built a course planning platform to help students explore and choose classes more easily. During the peak registration period, the server got overwhelmed, and I realized just how important reliability is. Even if a feature is helpful, it doesn’t matter if people can’t use it when they need it most. That experience really drove home the importance of putting the user first and building systems that hold up under pressure — values that I see reflected in how Amazon operates.

That’s the kind of environment I want to grow in — where expectations are high, but so is the impact. I’d be excited to learn from teams that build at scale and contribute to products that millions rely on every day.
