I'm particularly drawn to Amazon because of its relentless focus on delivering real value to customers. As a long-time user of Amazon Prime, I've seen how well Amazon handles complex systems — from fast delivery to accurate recommendations — and makes them feel simple and reliable to users.

From this, I can see that Amazon values putting users first, working efficiently, and doing things the right way instead of the easy way. These values reflect how I approach engineering — focusing on user needs, working quickly but carefully, and always aiming to improve the quality of what I build.

I believe Amazon is a place where I can grow my skills, learn from strong teams, and contribute to products that make a real difference in people’s lives.
